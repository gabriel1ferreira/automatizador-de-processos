# Legal Process Automator

This Python script automates the retrieval of legal process information from the [Tribunal de Justi√ßa de Minas Gerais (TJMG)](https://pje-consulta-publica.tjmg.jus.br/) website using Selenium. It allows you to enter an OAB (Brazilian Bar Association) number and a state, then collects and stores details about associated legal processes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Chrome WebDriver
- openpyxl


```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Run the script

4. Follow the prompts to enter the OAB number and the state of the legal professional you want to search for.

5. The script will collect information about the process, including the process number, date of distribution, and a list of movements, and store it in an Excel file named `dados.xlsx`.

## Customization

You can customize script behavior by modifying the Python code, such as adjusting wait times, XPaths, or the Excel file's name for data storage.
